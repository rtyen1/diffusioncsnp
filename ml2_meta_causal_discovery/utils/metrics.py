def calc_SHD(target, pred, double_for_anticausal=True):
    r"""Compute the Structural Hamming Distance.

    The Structural Hamming Distance (SHD) is a standard distance to compare
    graphs by their adjacency matrix. It consists in computing the difference
    between the two (binary) adjacency matrixes: every edge that is either
    missing or not in the target graph is counted as a mistake. Note that
    for directed graph, two mistakes can be counted as the edge in the wrong
    direction is false and the edge in the good direction is missing ; the
    `double_for_anticausal` argument accounts for this remark. Setting it to
    `False` will count this as a single mistake.

    Args:
        target (numpy.ndarray or networkx.DiGraph): Target graph, must be of
            ones and zeros.
        prediction (numpy.ndarray or networkx.DiGraph): Prediction made by the
            algorithm to evaluate.
        double_for_anticausal (bool): Count the badly oriented edges as two
            mistakes. Default: True

    Returns:
        int: Structural Hamming Distance (int).

            The value tends to zero as the graphs tend to be identical.
